# Weizenbaum Knowledge Hypercube Prototype

## What is the HyperCube?

The HyperCube is a framework developed by the Weizenbaum Institute for the support, visualization and result validation of interdisciplinary workshops. The HyperCube supports a moderated discussion process, which integrates the perspectives of all participants by combining and securing their insights, questions and possible solutions (= HyperCube session). At the center of the HyperCube is the development of a topic-focused mind map by the session participants. Their ideas and impulses are recorded in the form of core concepts and put in relation to each other, based on a process of discussing, prioritizing and documenting.


## Digitisation and Sustainability

The HyperCube was created in the cross-sectional area of »Digitisation and Sustainability« of the Weizenbaum Institute. The project emerged from the in-depth discussion of the sustainable development goals (SDGs) in the context of information and communication technologies (ICT). Among other sources, these initial discussions heavily relied on the main report Towards our Common Digital Future by the German Advisory Council on Global Change.
